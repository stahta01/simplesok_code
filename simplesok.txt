Simple Sokoban is a (simple) Sokoban game aimed at playability and portability across systems. It is written in ANSI C89, using SDL for user interactions. I developed it natively under x86_64 Linux, but it should compile just fine on virtually anything that has a C compiler and the SDL library.

 Features:
  - nicely animated movements,
  - unlimited level solutions,
  - unlimited undos,
  - 3 embedded level sets,
  - support for external *.xsb levels,
  - support for levels of size up to 62x62,
  - saving levels to clipboard,
  - ...

I provide a build of the game for a couple of Linux distributions via the openSUSE build service:
 http://software.opensuse.org/package/simplesok

A Windows (x86) build is available as well.

The source code is released under GNU GPL v3. Read the 'license.txt' file shipped with the game for details.

Simple Sokoban has been written by Mateusz Viste. However, the project wouldn't have been possible without the valuable work of other people:
 - Hiroyuki Imabayashi - The original creator of the Sokoban game,
 - Gerry Wiseman - Created graphical elements adapted by Simple Sokoban,
 - David W. Skinner - Designed the level sets embedded in Simple Sokoban.
