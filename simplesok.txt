Simple Sokoban is a (simple) Sokoban game aimed at playability and portability
across systems. It is written in ANSI C89, using SDL for user interactions.
I developed it natively under x86_64 Linux, but it should compile just fine on
virtually anything that has a C compiler and the SDL library.

 Features:
  - nicely animated movements,
  - unlimited level solutions,
  - unlimited undos,
  - 3 embedded level sets,
  - support for external *.xsb levels,
  - support for levels of size up to 62x62,
  - saving levels to clipboard,
  - ...

I provide a build of the game for a couple of Linux distributions via the
openSUSE build service:
 http://software.opensuse.org/package/simplesok

A Windows (x86) build is available as well.

The source code is released under GNU GPL v3. Read the 'license.txt' file
shipped with the game for details.


[ Loading external level files ]

Simple Sokoban can load levels from external *.xsb files. There are two ways
to load such file: either pass it as a parameter on command line, or drop the
file to the Simple Sokoban application window. Note, that the second method
will work only if your windowing system supports it.
Simple Sokoban is also able to load gzipped xsb files.


[ Command line parameters ]

Simple Sokoban accepts some command-line parameters. If a parameter is not
part of the known list of parameters, then Simple Sokoban assumes it is the
path to a XSB level file.

--framedelay=X      Adjusts the delay between frames to X ms. Use it if you'd
                    like to make Simple Sokoban slower/faster. The default
                    value is 9. This value must be in the range 0..64.


[ Credits ]

Simple Sokoban has been written by Mateusz Viste. However, the project
wouldn't have been possible without the valuable work of other people:

 - Hiroyuki Imabayashi - The original creator of the Sokoban game,
 - Gerry Wiseman - Created graphical elements adapted by Simple Sokoban,
 - David W. Skinner - Designed the level sets embedded in Simple Sokoban.
