for 1.0:
 - when moving the level, make the scrolling gentle (same rate as player's movement)
 - embedd "classic" levels (as designed by Thinking Rabbit in late 1981)
 - create a menu to choose levels family (microban(easy) classic sasquatch(hard)) - this might be integrated with the intro screen
 - create menu to choose levels, with only 3 unsolved levels being unlocked
 - organize ingame texts in some cleaner way
 - add the name of the level collection onscreen

undefined future:
 - allow to play the solution (if any)
 - add an internet levels mode
 - skins support
