for 1.0:
 - when moving the level, make the scrolling gentle (same rate as player's movement)
 - create menu to choose levels, with only 3 unsolved levels being unlocked
 - organize ingame texts in some cleaner way - implement some text-align capabilities in draw_string()

undefined future:
 - allow to play the solution (if any)
 - add an internet levels mode
 - skins support
